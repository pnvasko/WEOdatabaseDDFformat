Mexican authorities currently report fiscal data including the central government, financial and non-financial public corporations and entities, and the social security system. As of today, this is the relevant coverage level for policy discussion with Mexican authorities, and the team believes that it is important to keep the broadest available coverage. As the authorities continue transitioning toward GFSM2001 and report data accordingly, the Mexico team will be able to report data in line with GFSM2001, in particular regarding state governments. ï¿½ Valuation of public debt: Face value Primary domestic currency: Mexican peso Data last updated: 03/2015"

GGSB,GBR,"Source: National Statistical Office Latest actual data: 2014 Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the U.K. Treasury?s 2015 Budget, published in March  2015. However, on the revenue side, the authorities? projections are adjusted for differences between IMF staff forecasts of macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth) and the forecasts of these variables assumed in the authorities? fiscal projections.  On the expenditure side, given uncertainties pertaining to the May elections, a slightly slower pace of consolidation than that in the Budget is assumed for FY2016/17 and beyond, though fiscal projections are fully consistent with the fiscal mandates. In addition, IMF staff data exclude public sector banks and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the public sector in April 2012.

GGSB,USA,"Source: BEA and IMF's Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (revenue, expenditure, and net lending); Flow of Funds (debt) Latest actual data: 2013 Notes: Revenue, expenditure, and net lending data are compiled according to the GFSM2001 methodology. Due to data limitations, most series begin 2001. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the January 2015 Congressional Budget Office baseline adjusted for the IMF staff?s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The baseline incorporates the key provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, including a partial rollback of the sequester spending cuts in fiscal years 2014 and 2015. The rollback is fully offset by savings elsewhere in the budget. In fiscal years 2016 through 2021, the IMF staff assumes that the sequester cuts will continue to be partially replaced, in portions similar to those agreed upon under the Bipartisan Budget Act for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, with back-loaded measures generating savings in mandatory programs and additional revenues. Over the medium term, the IMF staff assumes that war drawdown will continue and Congress will continue to make regular adjustments to Medicare payments (DocFix) and will extend certain traditional programs (such as the research and development tax credit). The fiscal projections are adjusted to reflect the IMF staff?s forecasts of key macroeconomic and financial variables and different accounting treatment of financial sector support and of defined benefit pension plans and are converted to a general government basis.

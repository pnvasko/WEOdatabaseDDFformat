TXG_RPCH,BLR,"Source: National Statistical Office. Formally, the National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus Latest actual data: 2013 Notes: Belarus purchases crude oil from Russia at a price different from the world market price: they get it at a substantial discount. The dynamics of the imported oil price deflator is set by world prices as well as by the subsidy, so it does not follow world prices. Deflator of oil exports reflects (i) crude oil and (ii) oil products. Oil products are priced differently from crude oil. The historical values are taken from the authorities? data. Projections should be reasonably close to WEO?s numbers because we use POILAPSP for ?pricing? oil products in the projection period.

TXG_RPCH,TUR,"Source: Central Bank. Formally, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey Latest actual data: 2013 Notes: Oil trade includes other energy trade such as fuel. Therefore, the price of oil imports and oil exports will differ from the WEO assumption since it includes the price of other energy items such as gas, etc. The weights are about 70 percent oil and 30 percent gas for 2011. Base year: 2005 Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data) Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Trade volumes are the ratio of the value index to the Fisher unit value index (chain-weighted). The value indices are obtained as the ratio of current values to the arithmetic average of the base year values. Foreign trade indices have been calculated by Eurostat and U.N. concepts and methods. Chain-weighted: Yes, from 2003. Unit value indices are chain-weighted, but volume indices are not. Trade System: Special trade. Relaxed definition. Foreign trade statistics include goods which enter/leave the statistical territory of Turkey from/to other countries and are placed under the customs normal export and import procedures and under customs inward and outward processing procedures. Excluded items in trade: In transit;Low valued;Other;. Excluded items include goods valued under $100, transit trade, temporary export/import trade, repair and maintenance of goods, operational leasing, shuttle trade, border trade, some transactions with declaration that are not goods (cash, valuable paper, stamps, monetary gold, etc.). Other exclusions include border and coastal trade. Customs warehouses, free zones, and duty-free shops in Turkey are considered beyond the customs frontier.

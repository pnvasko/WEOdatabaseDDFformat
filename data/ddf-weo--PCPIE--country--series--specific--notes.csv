PCPIE,ARG,"Source: National Statistical Office Latest actual data: 2013 Notes: Consumer price data from December 2013 onwards reflect the new national CPI (IPCNu), which differs substantively from the preceding CPI (the CPI for the Greater Buenos Aires Area, CPI-GBA). Because of the differences in geographical coverage, weights, sampling, and methodology, the IPCNu data cannot be directly compared to the earlier CPI-GBA data. Because of this structural break in the data, the average CPI inflation for 2014 is not reported in the April 2015 World Economic Outlook. Following a declaration of censure by the IMF on February 1, 2013, the public release of a new national CPI by end-March 2014 was one of the specified actions in the IMF Executive Board?s December 2013 decision calling on Argentina to address the quality of its official CPI data. On December 15, 2014, the Executive Board recognized the implementation of the specified actions it had called for by end-September 2014 and the steps taken by the Argentine authorities to remedy the inaccurate provision of data. The Executive Board will review this issue again as per the calendar specified in December 2013 and in line with the procedures set forth in the Fund?s legal framework. Harmonized prices: No Frequency of source data: Monthly Base year: 2008. For end of period CPI, the base period is April, 2008.
